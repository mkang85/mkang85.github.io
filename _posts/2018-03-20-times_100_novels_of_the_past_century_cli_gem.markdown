Are you someone who likes to read?  Would you like to know what the best novels are?  Well you're in luck!  My CLI Gem allows you to go through Time Magazine's 100 Novels of the Past Century! (Note: these are not ranked, but sorted alphabetically.  Additionally, this list is only comprised of those novels that were written originally in English)

I hope you enjoy it! 

**What it does:**

The gem outlines and allows you to pick a title from Time Magazine's 100 Novels of the Century. 


**How does it do it?**
It scrapes the Time website for the titles, their position in the list, their  URLs and it also takes in input to return the user selection. 


**Why this?**
As a former avid reader, I built this to read all 100 novels this year!
