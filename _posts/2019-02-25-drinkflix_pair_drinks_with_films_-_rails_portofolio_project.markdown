Well, it's been a fun journey.  Took me several months to finish this project.  Let's recap: 

-Started in early October, going really well!
-Late October, my computer started freezing unexpectedly
-Late November, my computer is officially wrecked
-December, on forced vacation from coding, decide to embrace the holidays
-Late December, get the computer back in good health, but the holidays...
-Mid- January, reluctantly start getting back into it
-February, having existential crisis of forgetting everything. 
-Late February, decided to just start coding without worrying and went through in a flash!


I was definitely hesitant to get back into coding after spending essentially a 2 month hiatus.  I had forgoten a lot of concepts and I was feeling worse about the project day after day.  

For some reason I hit a breaking point and decided to just do some lines of code.  I somehow convinced myself that I just needed to refactor my view page for my drinks, and suddenly I was getting back into it.  I think I suffered that "imposter's syndrome" that is popular amongst coders.  I thought I had to know everything to really get this project together, but I found that just by doing it, by failing and by just being curious how to do things, I was learning and getting back into it.  

I am really happy how this turned out, and I am more than ecstatic now that it's over. 

So this rails app basically allows you to create a review for a film, and pair any type of drink you had while you watched it.  I hope you enjoy it!
