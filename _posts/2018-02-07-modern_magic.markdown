"To cast a spell is to spell..." 



-Aleister Crowley

Magic, is not what it seems.  From what I've seen on TV and the occasional bar trick, it often involves slight of hand or a planted device or person. 

However this was not always the case.  Magic was ritualistic.  It was ceremonies and spells often from ancient tomes filled with cryptic runes and numerology.  There was a time when people were afraid of curses, or confident in their business ventures all due to the magician's word.  And the magician's word, whether truly magical or not was powerful.  The root of all this power was language. 

Famed magician and comic book author Alan Moore (author of *Watchmen, V for Vendetta, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* explains in this clip the power of language and it's connection to magic:

Essentially, when applied to the modern age, the role of a developer is the same as a magician.  Through specific patterns of syntax, symbols, numbers, we are able to create websites, games, and social media platforms.  With coding languages, we can create those programs and apps that will allow us to talk to people across the globe, to receive news instanteously, to buy whatever we may need, to learn how to code all while staying within our own home.  

This is the reason why I decided to get into coding.  

I wanted to be part of the magic.
